# Kata: Number to French Converter

This repo presents an adventure of approaches for converting a number to french format strings(words).

Made using [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/) for two main reasons:
1. Gradio provides an excellet UI for easily accessing the application with required parameters.
2. For future purposes, where we will be integrating the Speech-To-Text and Text-To-Speech models for converting the spoken number to french representation.

This application basically takes 3 inputs. Their details are as follows:
1. **Input List of numbers:** [MANDATORY] This is a comma separated string that is splitted internally to process one number at a time.
2. **French Style**: [OPTIONAL] Currently two French Styles are followed, select from either of `France-French` or `Belgium-french`
3. **Output Type**: [OPTIONAL] Either of `JSON` or `LIST`.
    - if `JSON` is selected, a Dictionary of values corresponding to each input number is displayed.
    - if `LIST` is selected, a List of values are displayed in the given order of the input.


## Installation
Follow the below steps to run the application in your local machine:
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/DeathReaper0965/kata-number-convert-french.git`
2. Navigate to the repo: `cd kata-number-convert-french`
3. Create a new python 3.11 environment using: `conda create -n kata python=3.11` (This is helpful for separating the application's dependencies from system dependencies)
4. Activate the environment: `conda activate kata`
5. Install all required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

#### That's it, we're all done with the installation and all that's left is to start the app.

## Start the Application
To start the [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/) app, just execute the below command from the root folder of the repo.<br>
`python app.py`
<br>

Once started, just head over to [http://localhost:7860/](http://localhost:7860/) in any browser of your choice to see the application in action ðŸ˜„

**NOTE:** For the very first call, it may take time for the output, as Gradio initializes some necessary cache. However, all the subsequent calls will be very fast (often within fraction of seconds).

### Current Limitations and Next Steps
1. Currently supports only the numerical part conversion. 
2. Decimal part and Fractional numbers conversion to be added.
3. Speech-To-Text and Text-To-Speech Models are to be added with necessary changes in Gradio UI.
4. Unit Test Cases for the functionality added, mostly for checking to assert correct values at edge-cases.
